  Hi, I'm Jake 👋
 </h1>

### Grad student and hobby full stack developer.

🎓 I am currently a PhD student at the University of Oxford, where I split my time between labs in the UK and US. In my spare time I like to build **Node.js** apps but occasionally you'll find me scripting in **Python**. My favourite stack at the moment is **MERN** but I'm hoping to change that as I build new projects. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn if you're interested in a chat.

🌱 I'm currently working on a **React/Express** app for a non-profit. We are building an app to provide free cab rides to the AAPI community in NYC. This has involved building a frontend to manage requests for rides and RESTful APIs for manipulating requests in an admin dashboard.

🧗 Outside of my PhD and programming, I like to **climb**, **draw portraits**, **read books** and learn **Korean**. 요즘 제가 제일 좋아하는 한국 음식은 마푸두부예요!

✈️ Currently I'm working in the US but I like to travel a lot, so you will often find me travelling around Europe or sometimes somewhere more exotic like Ecuador.

📫 I can be reached at the links below. Happy to go for a coffee anytime and talk code.
